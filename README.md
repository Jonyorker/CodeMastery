# CodeMastery
A collection of calculations using a myriad of web technologies

In order to learn and understand a certain technology, you must first use it.

This Repo will hold a wide spread of mathematical, statistical and financial calculations, repeated using different languages and frameworks.

  <h2>Databases</h2>
  
  A user will be able to quickly create an account which they can use to save calculations for future reference. As such, I will use a database to both store the user information, as well as calculations.
  
  Both a traditional MySQL (mariaDB) and MongoDB will be employed. If possible, I would like to keep both with the same information, but I realize that might not be entirely feasible. Still, I welcome a challenge. Perhaps I can add a toggle to switch your application to use one database or the other, just for kicks.
